### 🚀 Wallace Tree Multiplier (4x4) – Verilog Implementation

This project implements a **4x4 Wallace Tree Multiplier** in Verilog, designed using a combination of **structural** and **dataflow modeling** techniques.

The Wallace Tree algorithm is a fast and efficient method for hardware multiplication. It reduces the number of partial products through multiple stages of full and half adders before the final addition stage.

#### 📌 Key Features:

* 4-bit × 4-bit multiplication
* Uses Wallace Tree reduction technique
* Final result obtained through a carry-propagate adder (CPA)
* Emphasizes **gate-level design** using **xor**, **and**, and bitwise **assign** operations

#### 🔧 Applications:

* Useful for digital design students exploring fast multiplication techniques
* Can be extended to higher bit-width multipliers
* Great foundation for FPGA/ASIC implementation of arithmetic units
